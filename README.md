`REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here`

### `Perequisite`
<ul>
  <li>Create an account if you don't have on TMDB. Because I use its free API to consume movie/tv data.</li>
  <li>And then follow the documentation to create API Key</li>
  <li>Finally, if you use v3 of TMDB API, create a file named .env.local, and copy and paste the content of .env.example. And then paste the API Key you just . created.</li>
